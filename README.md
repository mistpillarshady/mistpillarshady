# Get To Know Me

*Okay I never made a real repository before, but I'm sick of ppl not always reading my rentries/pronouns.cc.*

## Chrysanthemum (Chrys or Len for short) [*Main Syshost*]

I'm an OSDD system, or just plural in general, collectively going by He/They UNLESS said otherwise.

\+ AuDHD, CPTSD (suspected borderline + narcissistic traits), and a lot of anxiety/paranoia.

## DNI Criteria

**My DNI is pretty small and based on my personal comfort since my stances can be inconsistent or neutral;**

- **Basic DNI, so basically bigots fuck off. I think that's obvious tho.**
- **Proship (specifically Darkship/Illegal ships); I take no sides in shipcourse, but I'm not comfortable with darkshippers *whatsoever.***
- Antiship; I'm recovering from that stressful mindset and would rather NOT deal with y'all.
- **Any Cluster B abuse believers.**
- **Anti-SelfDX (I'm SelfDX).**

Again, this list is for my own comfort. If you fit my DNI or make me uncomfortable enough, you're probably already hidden or I'm keeping my eye on you...

Doubles of kins/fictives aren't on my DNI, but I do feel a bit uncomfortable around them if we aren't friends. IWC I guess???
